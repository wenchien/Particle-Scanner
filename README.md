<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

VIDE auto scans and packs asset files
CompilePal compiles AND auto scans as well as packing asset files
BSPZIPGUI packs asset files if you have gameinfo.txt set up correctly

Each has its own benefit but can we talk about the fact particle files (.pcf) contain .vmt files that need to be pack as well. If you have multiple project folders set up in the gameinfo.txt and use bspzipgui, you might miss some file since I don't think it has the auto-scans feature. This application aims to improve the workflow of pcf file organization. Since this is workflow that I'm used to and generally use, some might not find this useful.
